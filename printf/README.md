The available convertion specifiers are:
+ %c: Prints a single character.
+ %s: Prints a string of characters.
+ %d: Prints integers.
+ %i: Prints integers.
+ %b: Prints the binary representation of an unsigned decimal.
+ %u: Prints unsigned integers
+ %x: Prints the hexadecial representation of an unsigned decimal in lowercase letters
+ %X:Prints the hexadecial representation of an unsigned decimal in uppercase letters
+ %r: Prints a reversed string
+ %R: Prints the Rot13 interpretation of a string

## REQUIREMENTS

+ General: Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 All your files should end with a new line A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl You are not allowed to use global variables No more than 5 functions per file The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h Donâ€™t forget to push your header file All your heade

## Usage
+ All the files are to be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
+ Compile your code with `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c`
+ Include the "main.h" header file on the functions using the _printf()

#include "main.h"
#include <stdio.h>
/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */

int main(void)
{
	int a;
	int b;
	char *str;

	str = "school";
	a = _printf("%r\n", "Holberton"); /*expected: notrebloh*/

	b = _printf("%r\n", str); /*expected: loohcs*/
	printf("%d\n", b); /*expected: 7*/

	b = _printf("%r\n", str); /*expected: loohcs*/
	printf("%d\n", b); /*expected: 7*/
	return (0);
